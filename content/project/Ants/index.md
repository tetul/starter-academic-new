title: "Modulation of sucrose responsiveness in ants"
summary: "This is a bachelor thesis project with Sarah Peter. We will be using <i>Camponotus mus</i> to study the variation in sucrose responsiveness in freely moving ants, under different conditions of colony hunger states. In addition, we will study the modulation of this responsiveness by oral treatment of dopamine, a well known influencer of the reward system in animals. The experimental animals will be flash frozen for later analysis using mass spectrometry, to collect information about their neurochemical signatures"

## Update: Jan 2021
### Carbohydrate measurements
We have a new UV/Visible light spectrophotomter. Heike will help us use the phenol-sulfuric acid method to measure the total carbohydrates from ants samples from the different treatment groups. This way we will have an estimate of the extent of starvation treatment as another variable in our analyses. 
## Update: Dec 2020
### Data analysis
Now that the ants have all been tested, it is time to see if the hunger state and the dopamine treatments have an effect on their sucrose acceptance. Sarah will perform statistical tests on the data to determine this. Lets hope for success!

## Update: Nov 2020
### Ant brain dissections
After discussing with Marissa, Sarah has become an expert in partially freeze-drying and dissecting out the ant brains. They will wait in the deep freezer till the MS method is ready for them. 

## Update Oct 2020
### Experiment time
Sarah has managed to perform her experiments on her ants. So far, it is a success. We will wait till the data is analysed to see the final results.
