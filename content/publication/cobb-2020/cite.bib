 abstract = {Locomotion and mobility have been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster but less is known about the locomotor capacity of other Drosophila species, while the response to chronic exercise in other species has yet to be examined. We have shown that adult male D. melanogaster adapt to exercise training with improved running endurance, climbing speed, and flight ability compared to unexercised flies. Here, we examine baseline mobility of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. virilis, and their response to chronic exercise training. We found significant interspecific differences in mobility and in the response to exercise. Although there is a significant sex difference in exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, intraspecific analysis reveals few sex differences in other Drosophila species. As octopamine has been shown to be important for exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, we also asked if any observed differences could be attributed to baseline octopamine levels. We find that octopamine and tyramine levels have the same rank order as baseline climbing speed and endurance in males, but do not predict the response to chronic exercise in males or females. Future research should focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for the inter- and intraspecific differences in mobility and the response to exercise.},
