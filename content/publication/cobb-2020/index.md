abstract: Locomotion and mobility have been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster
  but less is known about the locomotor capacity of other Drosophila species, while
  the response to chronic exercise in other species has yet to be examined. We have
  shown that adult male D. melanogaster adapt to exercise training with improved running
  endurance, climbing speed, and flight ability compared to unexercised flies. Here,
  we examine baseline mobility of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. virilis, and their
  response to chronic exercise training. We found significant interspecific differences
  in mobility and in the response to exercise. Although there is a significant sex
  difference in exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, intraspecific analysis reveals
  few sex differences in other Drosophila species. As octopamine has been shown to
  be important for exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, we also asked if any observed
  differences could be attributed to baseline octopamine levels. We find that octopamine
  and tyramine levels have the same rank order as baseline climbing speed and endurance
  in males, but do not predict the response to chronic exercise in males or females.
  Future research should focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for the inter-
  and intraspecific differences in mobility and the response to exercise.
