abstract: Honey bee foragers show a strong diurnal rhythm of foraging activity, and
  such behavioral changes are likely under the control of specific neuromodulators.
  To identify and quantify neuromodulators involved in regulating rest and arousal
  in honey bees, we established a mass spectrometric method for quantifying 14 different
  neurochemicals and precursor molecules. We measured forager type and brain region
  specific differences in amine levels from individual honey bee brains and brain
  regions. The observed differences in amine levels between resting and aroused foragers
  resemble findings in other species indicating a conserved molecular mechanism by
  glutamate and GABA in regulating arousal. Subesophageal ganglion specific changes
  in the histaminergic system and global increases in aspartate during arousal suggest
  a possible role of histamine and aspartate in feeding and arousal, respectively.
  More aminergic systems were significantly affected due to arousal in nectar foragers
  than in pollen foragers, implying...
