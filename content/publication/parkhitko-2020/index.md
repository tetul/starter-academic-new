abstract: Aging is characterized by extensive metabolic reprogramming.
  To identify metabolic pathways associated with aging, we analyzed age-dependent
  changes in the metabolomes of long-lived Drosophila melanogaster
  . Among the metabolites that changed, levels of tyrosine were increased with age
  in long-lived flies. We demonstrate that the levels of enzymes in the tyrosine degradation
  pathway increase with age in wild-type flies. Whole-body and neuronal-specific downregulation
  of enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway significantly extends Drosophilatextless
  lifespan, causes alterations of metabolites associated with increased lifespan,
  and upregulates the levels of tyrosine-derived neuromediators. Moreover, feeding
  wild-type flies with tyrosine increased their lifespan. Mechanistically, we show
  that suppression of ETC complex I drives the upregulation of enzymes in the tyrosine
  degradation pathway, an effect that can be rescued by tigecycline, an FDA-approved
  drug that specifically suppresses mitochondrial translation. In addition, tyrosine
  supplementation partially rescued lifespan of flies with ETC complex I suppression.
  Altogether, our study highlights the tyrosine degradation pathway as a regulator
  of longevity.
