abstract: 'We investigated the peptide inventory of the corpora cardiaca (CC) of the
  honey bee, Apis mellifera, by direct tissue profiling using MALDI-TOF MS combined
  with proteomic approaches focusing on cysteine-containing peptides. An agatoxin-like
  peptide (ALP) was identified as a component of the glandular part of the CC and
  was associated with the presence of the adipokinetic hormone in mass spectra. Although
  abundant in the CC, ALP does not belong to the toxins observed in the venom gland
  of A. mellifera. Homologs of ALP are highly conserved in major groups of arthropods
  and in line with this we detected ALP in the CC of non-venomous insects such as
  cockroaches and silverfish. In the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, ALP
  was also identified in the CNS and stomatogastric nervous system. This is the first
  report that establishes the presence of ALPs in the neuroendocrine tissues of insects
  and further studies are necessary to reveal common functions of these peptides,
  e.g. as antimicrobial agents, ion channel modulators or classical neuropeptides.
  Biological significance: Among the messenger molecules of the nervous system, neuropeptides
  represent the structurally most diverse class and basically participate in the regulation
  of all physiological processes. The set of neuropeptides, their functions and spatial
  distribution are particularly well-studied in insects. Until now, however, several
  potential neuropeptide receptors remained orphan, which indicates the existence
  of so far unknown ligands. In our study, we used proteomic methods such as cysteine
  modification, enzymatic digestion and peptide derivatization, combined with direct
  tissue profiling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, for the discovery of novel putative
  messenger molecules in the neuroendocrine system. The described presence of agatoxin-like
  peptides in the nervous system of the honey bee and other insects was overseen so
  far and is thus a remarkable addition to the very well studied neuropeptidome of
  insects. It is not yet clear, if these toxin-like peptides act as antimicrobial
  agents, ion channel modulators or classical neuropeptides.'
